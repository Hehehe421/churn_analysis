### Findings: 
- There is a significant difference in **tenure** between Churned and Non-Churned cusomter, people who stayed longer in the plan may have a lower tendency to Churn. Which aling with the customer who has 2 years contract has the lower chance to Churn. 
- Customer who has a **higer Monthly Charges** are **more likely** to Churn, this is easy to understand that price is always one important factor to affect people's behavior.
- Contrary to Monthly Charges, people who churned actually has a **lower total charges** overall. This might because those people **stopped fast** after they joined the plan.  

### Next Steps:
- Bucket the Numerical Variables into Categorical Variable
- Look at the interactive affects on Churn/Non-Churned behavior
- Try to find the higest risk cluster of customer to Churn
